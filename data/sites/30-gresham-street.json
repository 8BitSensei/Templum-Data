   "description": "The structure located at 30 Gresham street seems to have been a large colonnaded temple, only the north-west corner has been uncovered so it is hard to say what the design of the temple was. The site has a long history of earlier ritual activity, with an artificial pond which received depositions, including the bronze arm of a statue pre-dating 50 CE. The temple was probably built in the later 1st or early 2nd CE, but was only short-lived and isn't believed to have survived the Hadrianic fire of 120 CE.",
