   "description": "An exceptional cremation ground found just outside of Chichester along the route of the A27 Westhampnett Bypass in 1992 by Wessex Archaeology. The site contained burials from the Late Iron Age, Roman, and early Anglo-Saxon periods together with a probable Bronze Age ring ditch. The excavators identified four rectangular or square trench-built timber structures (20277, 20657, 20761, and 20562) to the north-east of a circular burial space as shrines.",
