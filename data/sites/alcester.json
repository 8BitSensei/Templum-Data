  "description": "An extensive Romano-British settlement with evidence for many structures and an industry based on crafts like leather and metal working. No post Roman evidence is discussed, but no explicit date for the end of the settlement is provided. A number of buildings within enclosures existed through the settlements history, but one, in the shape of a parallelogram in the later 1st CE was interpreted as possibly a religious enclosure. Two uninscribed altars were found in the fill of a nearby well. ",
