   "description": "A square building (G) just to the east of the villa - on the highest part of the site. First identified during excavations in 1940, the large structure seems to have been of abnormal height, having a vaulted basement and a floor above that. The structure had a 'burial pit' 14ft deep in one corner, and while it did not have a temenos, it did have a cobbled courtyard containing the bones of young oxen. The structure appears to have had a black and white tessellated pavement and marble architectural features, such as architraves. It is suggested that the structure was a temple/mausoleum, based on comparisons with the Jordan Hill temple and the Temple of Janus in Autun, France. Scott suggests that the structure was used for grain storage at a later date, and was eventually demolished to provide building material for the nearby building (E) and other structures in the villa.\n\nNote that Martyn et al suggest the temple is building F, this appears to be a mistake, Scott identifies building G as a temple.",
