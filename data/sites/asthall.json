  "description": "A Roman roadside settlement at a river crossing, originating in the mid 1st CE and reaching its peak by the mid 2nd CE. It appeared to contract during the late 4th CE. A circular structure near the roadside inside the settlement was identified by aerial photography, but not archaeologically investigated. This circular structure was identified as a possible 'shrine'."
