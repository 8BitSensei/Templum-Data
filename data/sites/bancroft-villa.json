   "description": "A mid 2nd CE Mausoleum built in a pre-existing enclosure in the crest of a hill overlooking a Roman villa. The Mausoleum appears identical to a Romano-Celtic temple, except beneath the central cella is a sarcophagi. The mausoleum appears to have been demolished in the mid 4th CE (probably for villa refurbishments), but, nearby in another pre-existing enclosure a small circular unmortared stone shrine was built. This shrine had a central pit containing deposits of spear heads, coins, and a young pig, outside the shrine were the butchered remains of an adult female goat. This shrine has been dated up until the late 4th CE.",
