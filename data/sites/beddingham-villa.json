   "description": "A Roman villa structure that was built on the location of a Late Iron Age 'round house' of which later phases of construction appear to respect the curve of, despite the structure being long since gone. The 'round house' has been interpreted as a possible shrine due to its lack of domestic material and the reverence later builders seem to have shown it, despite no evidence of deposition activities. To the west of main building and in-line with the 'round house' is a square masonry structure also interpreted as a shrine. Probably first constructed in the third century, its foundations were widened in the northern and southern side at a later date, and subsequently an apsidal end was added to the west wall. Dating for this structure is uncertain as finds are minimal, but late Roman and early Saxon pottery of the late fourth or early fifth CE was found in a hollowed out area at the apsidal end of the structure suggesting activity continued until this date.
