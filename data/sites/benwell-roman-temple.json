   "description": "We know the temple was destroyed sometime in the 2nd Century. The latest coin issue was dated to 161 - 180 and there is evidence of burnt roof tiles and timbers, however, there is evidence of continued use as a burial ground. If the suspected burial just to the west is to be included we can push it's use to the 6th or 7th Century.",
