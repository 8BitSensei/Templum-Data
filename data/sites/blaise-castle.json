   "description": "A rectangular masonry building and graves at the peak of Blaise Hill, an Iron Age Hillfort. The masonry building is believed to be of Roman date and interpreted as a temple, but a medieval chapel is also possible. The hillfort appears to have been intensively occupied during the Iron Age and into the Roman period, at the north-west foot of the hill there is evidence of small-scale Iron Age quarrying. In the 3rd century CE the remains of neonatal infants were interred in this quarry, before larger scale quarrying began later that century. A road was constructed that seems to connect the Hill Fort directly to the quarry.",
