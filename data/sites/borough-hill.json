  "description": "A Bronze to Iron Age Hillfort, 3km south-west of the small Roman town of Norton. In the 2nd CE, the largest barrow cemetery in Britain developed. A northern enclosure contains a large Roman building with mosaics, tessellated pavements, and bath facilities, the primary activity appears to have been the 4th CE, but excavations were done during the 18th and 19th CE. A religious function for the building has been suggested, but a villa has been put forward as another option."
