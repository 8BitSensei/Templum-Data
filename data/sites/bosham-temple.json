   "description": "A site just west of Chichester first excavated by Mitchell in 1832. Black suggests that there may have been a temple following a unusual layout of a central room with three connected rooms on either side, the main room had a c. 2m deep pit which showed evidence of burning. Just to the south-west traces of a theatre like structure, to the north-east was a timber palisade, possibly delimiting a temenos, to the west a possible mosaic was found, and to the north was a building witch Mitchell reports contained a coin of Honorius dating to 393 CE to 423 CE.",
