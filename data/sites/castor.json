   "description": "A classical podium style temple first excavated by Artis in the 1820s. The temple is surrounded by a series of houses which appear to have been constructed in the mid 3rd CE, which appear to be associated with the pottery industry. Thompson goes as far as suggesting that the settlement was created by a potter's guild using profits from the industry. Very little seems to be known about the chronology of the temple, but it seems likely the temple was constructed along with/for the settlement, which would suggest it was constructed some time in the mid 3rd CE.
