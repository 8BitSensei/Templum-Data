   "description": "A square temple located 700 yards south-east of the villa beside the river Coln. The cella has been robbed away, but its existence was recorded in 1866. Lewis (1966) suggest a chronology beginning in the early to mid 2nd CE and ending in the late 4th CE. The Villa itself contains an octagonal nymphaeum which has Chi-Rho symbols inscribed into it, suggesting later Christian use. ",
