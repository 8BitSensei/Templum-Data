   "description": "The earliest ritual activity recorded at Chelmsford begins in 60 AD and shows continuous activity until the early 5th. The latest coin issue found on the site dates from 388 - 402 AD with the distinct possibility of later activity. The sites demise is likely connected to the end of the Roman town in which it sat to the east. Wickenden suggests a dedication to Mars.",
