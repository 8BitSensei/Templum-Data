   "description": "A small Late Iron Age sub-rectangular enclosure just to the north of two larger enclosures that seemed to have been Iron Age and Roman farmsteads on the outskirts of the small Roman town of Irchester. A hole at the centre of the small enclosure was identified as a 'tree-hole', and along with deposits of 'globular' jars, lead the researchers to identify this as a possible ritual site and the tree as the focus.",
