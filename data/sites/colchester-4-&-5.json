   "description": "A pair of square temples in their own temenos, 4 the southern and 5 the northern of the pair. They lie c. 200 yards north-east of the temenos of Colchester 2 on the river-plain. Lewis (1966) suggests a chronology ranging from the mid 1st CE to the late 4th CE. The earlier temple, 4, is suggested to have been built in wood around the year 50, before being destroyed by fire and rebuilt in stone around the year 75, a porch was added in the 3rd CE. The second temple, 5, is comparably short lived, being built in the later 1st CE and falling out of use by the later 2nd CE.",
