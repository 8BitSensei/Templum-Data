   "description": "Three circular flat-topped mounds were excavated in the 50s and produced large amounts of Roman personal and building material dating mostly of 2nd to 4th CE. The Rural Settlement of Roman Britain project has tenuously interpreted this as a shrine, even though the original report does not. They compare it to the nearby circular temple at Nettleton Scrub.",
