During the late 2nd CE, the site was re-organised, and the shrine rebuilt as a stone Romano-Celtic temple with enclosure wall, this went through further alterations around 280 CE. During the 3rd and 4th CE, the now simple house and agricultural buildings fell into disuse, but the temple may have still been standing beyond 400 CE.",
