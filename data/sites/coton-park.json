   "description": "Romano-British farming settlement with earlier Iron and Bronze Age activity. The Romano-British activity has been dated to the 1st to 2nd CE, during this time there was a circular structure with concentric circular enclosure ditches. This has been interpreted as a Romano-British shrine, despite a lack of votive deposits.",
