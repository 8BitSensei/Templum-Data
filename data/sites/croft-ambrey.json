   "description": "Iron Age Hillfort occupied between 550 BCE and 50 CE. Activity continued on the Hillfort with artificial earth platforms built within an annexe. Stake holes, charcoal, pits, and hearths discovered inside, though what the superstructure was is unclear. In the late 2nd CE it was replaced by a defined square mound with stone kerbs, three other artificial platforms remain un-excavated. These structures have been interpreted as shrines, based upon finds \u0026 position, the end date for activity is uncertain.",
