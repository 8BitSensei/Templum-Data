   "description": "A small classical temple built just to the west of the first forum in the east of Roman London, built at the same time, around 75 CE. The temple lay roughly 10 metres west, on the outside of the forum, now under the building between Lombard St and Bell Inn Yard. The temple was short lived and was demolished while the second, much larger forum was being constructed around 100 CE - 130 CE. No new temple was built to replace it.",
