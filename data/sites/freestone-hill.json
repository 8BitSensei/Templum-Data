   "description": "A hillfort site in South East Ireland, two shrines outside the hillfort and a third on the summit have been identified. Based on their form and material they show a close similarity to the Romano-British Shrines and Temples of the Severn valley. The sites chronology is uncertain but depositional activity can be attributed to the mid 3rd CE and the 4th CE.",
