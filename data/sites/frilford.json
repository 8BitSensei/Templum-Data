   "description": "A site with two temples, the earlier is described as a circular shrine, the later is a square temple. Located on the edge of a ridge beside the river Ock. For the later square temple (Frilford 2), Lewis (1966) suggests a chronology beginning in the later 1st CE, annexes were added in the late 3rd CE and early 4th CE, and fell into 'decay' at some point in the 5th CE.",
