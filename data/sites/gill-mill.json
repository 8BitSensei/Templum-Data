   "description": "A possible temple site, where sample trenching in 1989 uncovered numerous 3rd to 4th century coins and stone relief of a Genius, broken in antiquity. The Genius reportedly stood in an aedicula. A relief of a rider-god was re-used and set into the mill in 1853, judging by the inscription.",
