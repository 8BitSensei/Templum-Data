   "description": "A shrine is suggested to have been somewhere under the modern Goldsmith's Hall. Masonry foundations are reported to have been recorded there, and a probably 2nd CE altar with an image identified as Diana was found there.\n\nIt's also notable that the site is only roughly 300 metres north-west of the two Gresham Street temples.",
