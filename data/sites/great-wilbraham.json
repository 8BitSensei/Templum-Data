   "description": "Roman Villa complex dated by pottery to the 2nd - 4th CE. Just to the south is a chalk platform with a circular it cut into it. Inside the pit was placed a column base and altar during the later 4th CE. The structure, due to the presence of altar is suggested by the RSRB to be a shrine.",
