   "description": "A Romano-Celtic temple located in the east of modern day Greenwich Park. The site is located on a hill-top which would of been along Watling Street before it went on to Roman London. The site had an incomplete inscription dedicating the temple to the Imperial Divinities, as well as a roof tile with the London procurial stamp, suggesting that the temple was built on imperial order.\n\nThere are associated buildings such as a guest house, as well as a free standing statue of Diana Venatrix.",
