   "description": "A 2nd CE octagonal masonry shrine within a ditched enclosure on the flank of a Bronze Age barrow with ancillary building. Dismantled during the 3rd CE but was re-established in the early 4th CE as a square post-built shrine on the crown of the barrow. Again was dismantled in the mid 4th CE due to flooding but now abandoned.",
