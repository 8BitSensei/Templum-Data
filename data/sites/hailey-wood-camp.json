   "description": "A large double ditched enclosure identified by aerial photography. It lies 5 km South-West of Cirencester on a spur at the head of a valley, further down the same valley isa spring which forms the source of the river Thames, overlooked by Trewsbury House hillfort. Only surveys have occurred so far, but the evidence found suggests a date range between the 1st CE and the late 4th CE, based on coins and pottery. The main reason for identifying this as a religious complex is its similarity in form to other sites such as Gosbecks, and Lee's Rest, as well as seven curse tablets recovered from the site. Two of these curse tablets reportedly mention Mercury. ",
