  "description": "Later Roman settlement occupying an Early Iron Age enclosure with continued activity into the 5th CE. The enclosure contained a smaller oval enclosure that has been interpreted as a possible shrine due to two unique structured deposits including an iron saw, bucket handles, animal bone, iron nails and steelyard balance in one and a shale spindle whorl, quern fragment, pottery, animal bone, hobnail and Neolithic flint core in the other. Though none of this material is strikingly religious in character.",
