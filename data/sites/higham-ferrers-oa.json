   "description": "A 2nd CE Roman road-side settlement which was eventually abandoned in the later 4th CE, with some Saxon re-settlement in the mid-5th CE. During the late 2nd - early 3rd CE on the western side of the site a monumental shrine complex was established. In the late 2rd - early 4th CE the site expanded to the north and the shrine complex was abandoned, with a small 'temple' being established to the north.",
