   "description": "Settlement activity detected on a site dating to the late 4th or early 5th CE. The site shows evidence of a Middle or Late Iron Age settlement, but this is not continuous with the later activity. An extensive midden pit demarcated by ditches and dating to the late 4th or early 5th CE provided extensive material suggesting religious activity including a curse tablet. The pit was likely formed during a single event, and has been used to suggest the presence of an as of yet undetected shrine.",
