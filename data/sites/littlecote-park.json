   "description": "Metalled road and possible Roman fort from the mid 1st CE, a settlement developed in the later 1st CE in the remains of the fort. A building with a porched entrance was interpreted as a shrine, though little reason is given. In the later 2nd CE (post 170) a villa was established, in the mid/late 4th CE an agricultural building was converted into a multi-room building with a bathsuite and attached 'tri-conch' hall with Orpheus mosaic. This room has been interpreted as a 'cult hall'. The villa was abandoned or demolished in the early 5th CE, though there is some evidence of sub-Roman buildings.",
