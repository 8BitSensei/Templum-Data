   "description": "A Late Iron Age site that can better be described as an extended set of farms. Some of the farms originating in the Iron Age were abandoned by the 4th CE, but some were founded in the Roman period and lasted into the 5th CE. A potential rectilinear 'ceremonial enclosure' which was replaced in the Roman period by a circular structure was identified. This seems to be the reason the RSRB has identified the site as containing a 'shrine'.",
