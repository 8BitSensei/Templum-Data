   "description": "Early Roman villa, likely constructed around 100 CE. A square temple/mausoleum was constructed in the early 4th CE just to the north of the villa. One of the rooms of the villa was converted into a house chapel after 360 CE, but it is suggested that 'pagan' worship continued in a room below this one. It now seems that the villa was abandoned after a fire, probably around 420.",
