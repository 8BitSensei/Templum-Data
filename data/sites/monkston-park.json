   "description": "The site of a rural settlement developed on the slopes of the valley system from the Late Iron Age until it's gradual abandonment towards the end of the 4th CE. From 250 CE the settlement expanded establishing a large sub-divided enclosure on the valley slope, the more northerly of which contained a timber post and masonry footed enclosure. This structure has been identified as a possible shrine because it produced a large amount of animal bone, a complete dog skeleton, and 8 late 4th CE coins. ",
