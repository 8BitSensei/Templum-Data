   "description": "A site excavated in 1982 that showed a large and popular site centered around an Octagonal temple which started out as a smaller circular shrine. Wedlake suggests that the initial shrine was constructed soon after 69 CE and no later than 210 CE, the site was built up over time and possibly re-used as a church and homestead while a small part of it was used for worship until around 370 CE.",
