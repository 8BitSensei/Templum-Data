   "description": "Two Roman agricultural settlements half a kilometre apart (treated as a single site in the record). The NE settlement included a double ditched rectangular enclosure to the rear, no internal features were found but some pottery and 3 late Roman coins were identified. RSRB identifies this as a possible shrine due to the presence of a similar double ditched enclosure 7km to the north which was apparently interpreted as a shrine, but has not yet been excavated.",
