   "description": "A large octagonal building surrounded by what appears to be an ambulatory was constructed sometime after 120 CE on the site of the modern Old Bailey building. Prior to this the site appears to have been the center of the glass working industry in Roman London.\n\nThe structure has been interpreted as a Romano-Celtic temple, though not much more is known and Perring and Brigham now prefer to interpret it as a 'secular' structure.",
