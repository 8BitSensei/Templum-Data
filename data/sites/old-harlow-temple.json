   "description": "A square temple in a temenos located on a low hill beside the river Stort. Lewis (1966) suggests a chronology ranging from the mid to late 3rd CE and ending in the late 4th or early 5th CE, but it now seems that it was a late Iron Age shrine succeeded by a masonry temple in the 80s CE.
