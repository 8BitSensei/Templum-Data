   "description": "A Neolithic oval barrow which shows evidence for Roman period ritual activuty. Dating is primarily through coin depositons, the bulk dating from 260 to 378 but the earliest is from 117. Some Roman roof tiles were found, the excavator suggested the possibility of a Roman shrine but this was not discovered. This entry is very tentative, and may be removed based on further research.",
