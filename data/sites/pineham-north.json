   "description": "A farming settlement that seems to begin in the 2nd/1st BCE that went through at least three phases of development in the Roman period, with tentative evidence for late 5th - early 6th CE Anglo-Saxon activity. The site was remodelled during the late 1st or 2nd CE, during this time a stone founded circular building with tiled roof was constructed outside the main enclosure. Activity tailed off in the late 2nd - early 3rd CE, and when it began to increase again in the late 3rd CE the circular structure had gone out of use. This building has been interpreted as a possible shrine.",
