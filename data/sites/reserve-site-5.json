  "description": "A Late Iron Age enclosed domestic site. Among domestic features was found a rectangular stone surface made of limestone slabs surrounded by areas of burning and a deposit of burn pig remains. Very tentatively interpreted as ritual by the excavators, and the Rural Settlement of Roman Britain project went further in categorising it as a 'shrine'. "
