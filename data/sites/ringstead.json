  "location": "England, Northamptonshire",
  "description": "Romano-British settlement with evidence for industrial activity, and a Late Iron Age settlement though without continuous settlement between the two. A later but not well dated circular stone building with tesselated floor was constructed, and appears to have still been in use by the 4th CE. The author of the report suggested that the circular building may have been a shrine. A segment of large decorated column was found and suggested to be a Jupiter column, though this doesn't seem like a good match for the nature of the site."
