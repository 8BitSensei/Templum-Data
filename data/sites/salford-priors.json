   "description": "Agricultural settlement initially focused around a double enclosure. During the 3rd to 4th CE a rectangular building with stone foundations was constructed, it has been interpreted as a cottage style building. Based on pottery evidence the building continued to be used until the mid or late 4th CE with some coin finds from later periods. Based on the distribution of coins within the cottage, a domestic shrine has been suggested.",
