   "description": "Two square temples located in a temenos just inside the east gate of Silchester Roman town. Temple 1 is the northern and Temple 2 is the southern of the pair. Lewis suggests a chronology of their construction in the late 1st CE and ending in the late 4th CE. There chronologies are identical, suggesting they were constructed and used as a pair.",
