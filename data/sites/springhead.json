   "description": "A large complex at the 'springhead' of the former river Ebbsfleet. The site held a whole series of temples, shrines, sanctuaries, enclosures through the Late Iron Age and Roman period. It is suggested the complex may have lasted into the 4th CE but the bulk of activity is confined to the 2nd CE.",
