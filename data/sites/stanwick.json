   "description": "A large and complex settlement site that began in the late iron age, and continued into the Roman period with multiple enclosures and a large villa. By the 5th CE the villa was housing corndriers, and early Saxon graves cut into buildings. During the Roman period a bronze age barrow and cemetery was surrounded by a temenos, and has been interpreted as a shrine.",
