   "description": "Roman administrative settlement established in the early - mid 2nd CE with substantial masonry buildings and a major tower. A Romano-Celtic temple lay just to the north but went out of use along with the main admin buildings in 220 CE. The settlement continued on in an agricultural capacity to the 5th - 6th CE. Other interpretations of the settlement have been put forward, suggesting that the whole thing is a religious complex and the major tower is a temple.",
