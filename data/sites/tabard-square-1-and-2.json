   "description": "Two Romano-Celtic temples built in the later 2nd CE in a temenos that may have been pre-existing for a number of years. The north temple appears to have been dedicated to Mars Camulus early on, there is also another dedication relating to the imperial cult.  \n\nDuring the 3rd CE the temples appear to have become much more popular, as a substantial structure was built to the south-east and is interpreted as a guest house, while to the north-east, an area with several plinths that could of been bases for statues has been interpreted as a gathering area.\n\nThe southern temple had been demolished some time in the later 3rd CE, while the northern one continued in use. It has been suggested that use of the northern temple didn't continue much longer after the late 4th CE as this seems to be when the dedication to Mars Camulus was deposited in a pit, but this isn't certain.",
