   "description": "Also known as Colchester 1, the Temple of Claudius in Colchester now forms the base of the Norman Colchester castle. Lewis suggests a construction time of mid 1st CE and fell out of use in the late 4th or at the latest early 5th CE (this may be an assumption of Lewis'). It is believed to have been sacked during the Boudican revolt of 60 - 61 CE, and that it was the centre of the Imperial Cult for Britain (though it may have moved to London later).",
