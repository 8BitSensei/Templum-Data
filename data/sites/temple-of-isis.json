   "description": "The Temple of Isis is only known from two inscriptions, the first is a jug from Tooley Street which read ''To London at the temple of Isis\", and the second of which is an altar from the riverside wall at modern Cast Baynards St which records the refurbishment of the temple due to disrepair sometime around the 250s CE.\n\nIt is not known where the temple was or whether these inscriptions refer to a single site or two. Bradley and Butler suggest that one of the monumental arches that formed the riverside corners of the public complex in the south-west of Roman London may have been a temple or shrine to Isis, as they appear to have the space for a central statue. It is not suggested which it may have been, but the other may have been the Temple of Jupiter, recorded as being refurbished around the same place and time.",
