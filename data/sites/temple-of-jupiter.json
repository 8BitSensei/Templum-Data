   "description": "The Temple of Jupiter is a Temple that would of been located in the southwest quadrant of Roman London. We only know about it from an altar that recorded it's refurbishment after falling into a state of disrepair some time in the 250s CE. The altar was found re-used as building material in the riverside wall (which runs roughly along modern Castle Baynards St) which was constructed to sure-up the unstable land sometime around 270 CE.\n\nThis leads us to believe that it was probably part of the public precinct immediately to the north, Bradley and Butler suggest it may well have been one of the monumental apses that formed that the riverside corners of the complex and each appear to have had the space to hold a statue. It's not known which it might have been, but the other may have been the Temple of Isis, also recorded as being refurbished around the same time and place.",
