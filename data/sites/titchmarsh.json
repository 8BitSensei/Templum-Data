   "description": "A site known mainly through metal detecting, small finds, aerial photography, and quarrying. Late Iron Age coins show have been used to suggest that the site was a ritual centre in the Iron Age, and crop marks that show a square enclosure have been used to suggest the presence of a possible shrine or temple during the Roman period.",
