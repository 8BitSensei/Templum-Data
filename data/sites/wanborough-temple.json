   "description": "A ritual site showing activity from the mid 1st to the late 4th CE. Earliest phases show little evidence for structure, but a later circular temple was built before it collapsed and a Romano-British temple was constructed just to the South. It is notable for the priestly regalia found associated with the site.",
