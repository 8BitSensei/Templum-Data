   "description": "A square Romano-Celtic type temple four-miles north east of Oxford and built on top of a hill. First refered to in 1841 by Hursey, who mentions traces of buildings at the site. Though the Saxon charter of Eaton (904 CE) may refer to the site as faga flora (coloured floor), referencing mosaics, but this not certain. Excavations in 1952 revealed a two-period temple, the earlier of which was dated to the 1st century CE, less is known about the second phase but it was probably constructed in the mid 2nd century CE. Iron Age occupation at the site has been shown but this is not neccesarily continuous and no structure is known.",
