   "description": "Two temples near Cheltenham on the valley-side by the river Coln. The former (Wycomb 1) is an earlier rectangular 'shrine', the later (Wycomb 2) is built over an earlier rectangular shrine. Lewis (1966) suggests that Wycomb 2 was constructed in the late 3rd CE and fell out of use in the early 5th CE.",
