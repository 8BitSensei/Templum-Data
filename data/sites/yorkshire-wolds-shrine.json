   "description": "A recently excavated site in the Yorkshire Wolds, reported as an Iron Age shrine with some later Roman activity. The site is located a few hundred yards from a substantial fortified settlement which has also been recently excavated. Both sites were first identified over in the late 20th CE by Stoertz as aerial photographs.",
