There is some evidence to suggest that the spring had some ritual significance prior to the Roman structure, it has also been shown that the ritual use of the site continued strongly into the 4th Century with continued deposition of coins, defixiones, and modifications to the temple itself. Aquae Sulis is unique in that it is one of the few sites we have a contemporary reference to in Solinus, De Mirabilibus Mundi, Capitula XXIIII."

The site consists of two concentric masonry foundations (17.5m x 16m) and (8.5, x 7.5m) enclosing a slightly off-centre rectangle which has been interpreted as a possible foundation of a plinth, altar, statue, or else a pool or well. The entrance is more than likely on the east side, though this is not clear from aerial photography.\n\nThe site (SU 8090 0644) overlooks a nearby stream at the bottom of a gentle slope to the east. Just outside the temple between itself and the river is a large circular structure with a large central depression 21m in diameter and an encircling ditch of 31m in diameter. Rudling postulates an earlier shrine or location for depositions.\n\nNo excavation has been carried out so the date can only be suggested from surface level finds. The earliest finds are Late iron age pottery and coins (Rudling, 2008). The bulk of pottery is late first and second centuries, but one sherd may be third or fourth century (King, Soffe, 1983)."

      "description": "Richborough Castle began as a temporary military camp for Plautius' invasion force in 43 AD, the only settlement prior to this was an Iron Age farmstead that was abandoned around 100 BC. At the end of the first century AD timber structures were cleared away and the site became a more permanent civilian settlement with an associated port. In the late third century AD the site again became a military establishment, the central part of the town was levelled and the monument constructed to celebrate the conquest of Britain was converted into a signal station, this signal station was eventually levelled to construct a shore fort. Around this time, it is suggested that the two Roman-Celtic temples to the south were constructed. By the end of the fourth century the fort was no longer garrisoned by regular troops, though the fort continued to be used as a settlement into the fifth century where it is noted in the Notitia Dignitatum. Around this time the temples would have already collapsed but continued to be used as two deposits were found inserted into the wall, it is around this same time that the proposed church associated with the baptismal font was constructed. It is unsure when these structures stopped being used but the fort was abandoned during the later fifth and sixth centuries."

One, under the south-east quadrant of the Salvation Army International HQ building, and the other just to the west on Peter's Hill. The two temples were built not long after much of the complex appears to have been demolished for refurbishment and to sure-up the riverside wall. \n\nIt appears that the temples may have never been actually completed. Due to the dating of dendrochronology allowing us to establish the beginning of construction so tightly (spring to summer 294 CE), it has been suggested the construction was initiated by Carausius as a project to promote his authority during the Carusian Revolt and that the project was never finished due to the assassination of his successor Allectus and the re-conquest of Britain in 296 CE.\n\nBradley and Butler have suggested that the temples may be a kind of 'successor' to the earlier monumental apses which had been destroyed earlier and are roughly in the same location. They have also suggested that these apses were temples or shrines to Jupiter and Isis, so these later temples may have been intended to be dedicated to the same deities."

Bradley and Butler suggest that one of the monumental arches that formed the riverside corners of the public complex in the south-west of Roman London may have been a temple or shrine to Isis, as they appear to have the space for a central statue. It is not suggested which it may have been, but the other may have been the Temple of Jupiter, recorded as being refurbished around the same place and time."

The 'round house' has been interpreted as a possible shrine due to its lack of domestic material and the reverence later builders seem to have shown it, despite no evidence of deposition activities. To the west of main building and in-line with the 'round house' is a square masonry structure also interpreted as a shrine. Probably first constructed in the third century, its foundations were widened in the northern and southern side at a later date, and subsequently an apsidal end was added to the west wall. Dating for this structure is uncertain as finds are minimal, but late Roman and early Saxon pottery of the late fourth or early fifth CE was found in a hollowed out area at the apsidal end of the structure suggesting activity continued until this date.

The site is also north of, and uphill from a series of undated ring ditches. A trackway connectes the site with a nearby Iron Age settlement and burials, and later forms a direct link to the nearby villa.\n\nThe site is surrounded by a square enclosure, possibly of late iron age date, along with pottery (which Malim characterised as Late Iron Age and Belgic in nature) and other morphological similarities to LIA sites, Malim deems it reasonable to suggest a late prehistoric date for it's construction. But, the bulk of development appears to be late 1st or 2nd CE in date based on artifactual finds. A square double walled structure with circular foundations at the centre has been identified as a Romano-Celtic temple, though it is also suggested that the circular foundation shows similarities with sites of prehistoric date.  At some point a small structure was built within the main enclosure, and contained an inhumation burial, this was interpreted as a mausoleum of Roman date. A similar structure exists inside the circular foundations of the temple, though this was not fully excavated, it may be another mausoleum.\n\nThere is a lack of evidence for use of the site in the later 2nd - 4th century, but during the Anglo-Saxon period the site seems to have become used as a limited burial ground, with a number of burials and a post-hole structure being created in the main enclosure. These burials seem to have respected the temple, which Malim takes to indicate some continuity of belief, if not ritual activity.\n"

This led Stead and Rigby to suggest the presence of a second temple, though they did not identify a structure. Martyn et al seem to propose 'Building V' in the area of the votive finds as the second temple. This building seems to have been formed by a ring of upright timbers and appears to be surrounded by an enclosure (ditches 54, 56, 89). There are three internal pits in the structure but no dating evidence was found, the votive material and statue however, appear to range from the late 2nd to late 4th CE. "

The structure had a 'burial pit' 14ft deep in one corner, and while it did not have a temenos, it did have a cobbled courtyard containing the bones of young oxen. The structure appears to have had a black and white tessellated pavement and marble architectural features, such as architraves. It is suggested that the structure was a temple/mausoleum, based on comparisons with the Jordan Hill temple and the Temple of Janus in Autun, France. Scott suggests that the structure was used for grain storage at a later date, and was eventually demolished to provide building material for the nearby building (E) and other structures in the villa.\n\nNote that Martyn et al suggest the temple is building F, this appears to be a mistake, Scott identifies building G as a temple."

      "description": "A mid 2nd CE Mausoleum built in a pre-existing enclosure in the crest of a hill overlooking a Roman villa. The Mausoleum appears identical to a Romano-Celtic temple, except beneath the central cella is a sarcophagi. The mausoleum appears to have been demolished in the mid 4th CE (probably for villa refurbishments), but, nearby in another pre-existing enclosure a small circular unmortared stone shrine was built. This shrine had a central pit containing deposits of spear heads, coins, and a young pig, outside the shrine were the butchered remains of an adult female goat. This shrine has been dated up until the late 4th CE."

      "description": "A large double ditched enclosure identified by aerial photography. It lies 5 km South-West of Cirencester on a spur at the head of a valley, further down the same valley isa spring which forms the source of the river Thames, overlooked by Trewsbury House hillfort. Only surveys have occurred so far, but the evidence found suggests a date range between the 1st CE and the late 4th CE, based on coins and pottery. The main reason for identifying this as a religious complex is its similarity in form to other sites such as Gosbecks, and Lee's Rest, as well as seven curse tablets recovered from the site. Two of these curse tablets reportedly mention Mercury. "

      "description": "A rectangular masonry building and graves at the peak of Blaise Hill, an Iron Age Hillfort. The masonry building is believed to be of Roman date and interpreted as a temple, but a medieval chapel is also possible. The hillfort appears to have been intensively occupied during the Iron Age and into the Roman period, at the north-west foot of the hill there is evidence of small-scale Iron Age quarrying. In the 3rd century CE the remains of neonatal infants were interred in this quarry, before larger scale quarrying began later that century. A road was constructed that seems to connect the Hill Fort directly to the quarry."
