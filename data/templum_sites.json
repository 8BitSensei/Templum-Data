      "description": "An early Roman period temple set around a natural spring with an adjoining bath complex. There is some evidence to suggest that the spring had some ritual significance prior to the Roman structure, it has also been shown that the ritual use of the site continued strongly into the 4th Century with continued deposition of coins, defixiones, and modifications to the temple itself. Aquae Sulis is unique in that it is one of the few sites we have a contempory reference to in Solinus, De Mirabilibus Mundi, Capitula XXIIII.",

The site consists of two concentric masonry foundations (17.5m x 16m) and (8.5, x 7.5m) enclosing a slightly off-centre rectangle which has been interpreted as a possible foundation of a plinth, altar, statue, or else a pool or well. The entrance is more than likely on the east side, though this is not clear from aerial photography.\n\nThe site (SU 8090 0644) overlooks a nearby stream at the bottom of a gentle slope to the east. Just outside the temple between itself and the river is a large circular structure with a large central depression 21m in diameter and an encircling ditch of 31m in diameter. Rudling postulates an earlier shrine or location for depositions.\n\nNo excavation has been carried out so the date can only be suggested from surface level finds. The earliest finds are Late iron age pottery and coins (Rudling, 2008). The bulk of pottery is late first and second centuries, but one sherd may be third or fourth century (King, Soffe, 1983).",

At the end of the first century AD timber structures were cleared away and the site became a more permanent civilian settlement with an associated port. In the late third century AD the site again became a millitary establishment, the central part of the town was leveled and the monument constructed to celebrate the conquest of Britain was converted into a signal station, this signal station was eventually leveled to construct a shore fort. Around this time, it is suggested that the two Roman-Celtic temples to the south were constructed. By the end of the fourth century the fort was no longer garrisoned by regular troops, though the fort continued to be used as a settlement into the fifth century where it is noted in the Notitia Dignitatum. Around this time the temples would have already collapsed but continued to be used as two deposits were found inserted into the wall, it is around this same time that the proposed church associated with the baptismal font was constructed. It is unsure when these structures stopped being used but the fort was abandoned during the later fifth and sixth centures.",
